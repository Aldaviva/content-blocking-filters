# Content Blocking Filters
*Filter lists for uBlock Origin*

## What is blocked
### Twitter Politics
- Politics, mostly from America
- Racism
- Fascism
- Environmentalism
- Anything else that's popular, depressing, and unsolvable (*e.g.* COVID-19)

### Twitter Minimal UI
- Timeline interruptions
    - Discover New Lists
    - Who To Follow
    - Expand Your Timeline With Topics 

*You can also install my [Twitter user style](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userstyles/raw/master/styles/twitter.user.css) to make the Twitter webapp even more minimal. These two files complement each other and I recommend installing both; one does not replace the other.*
